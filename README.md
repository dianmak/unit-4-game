Crystal Collector Game - Mythomagic Version

This is a game where the player's goal is to click one of the four "crystals" (in this game, our crystals are icons of Greed gods and goddesses) until her score reaches the goal, which is set randomly at the beginning of every game between 19-120. Every icon is assigned a new number between 1-12 at the start of every game - this value is hidden and can only be discovered by trial and error. If your score exceeds the goal number, you lose and start a new game. 

HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery were used.
